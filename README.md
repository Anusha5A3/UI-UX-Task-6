# UI-UX-Task-6
I conducted usability testing for my Food Delivery App prototype with 4 users. The feedback showed that the design was clear, but users wanted better color contrast and more realistic images for the restaurant menu. Based on this, I updated the screens by adding color, food images, and clearer buttons. After the improvements, users found the app more attractive and easier to navigate.
